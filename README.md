# Cartisse

This repository contains **Cartisse**, a modified version of [XCharter](https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/xcharter/), which is an extension for [Bitstream Charter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitstream_Charter).

## What is this?

**Cartisse is specifically intended to be used with Kobo e-readers.** You can also use it for general word processing and the like, but if you need more glyph coverage or advanced typography features I recommend looking at alternatives like [Charis](https://software.sil.org/charis/download/). 

Take a look at a screenshot of it on my [Kobo Libra Color](https://be.kobobooks.com/nl/products/kobo-libra-colour?variant=40852311736406) here:

This version omits a few ligatures that consistently looked bad on e-ink displays and has adjusted metrics for improved line height. 

A more verbose [license](./LICENSE) is also included as part of the distributed font files.

## How was this made?

Automatically, with a script. The following changes are made:

- A few ligatures that did not render well on certain e-readers were removed, namely: `ff`, `ffi`, `ffl`, `fl`, `fi`.
- Some minor tweaks to kern pairs were made to tighten up the look and feel of the font, and to address the removed ligatures.
- Improved line height metrics were set (updated ascent/descent metrics).
- The copyright notice has been updated to reflect the new name.

### Kern pair changes

I've included a file called [kern.md](./doc/kern.md) in this repository. I've checked and improved kern pairs to ensure these particular sentences look fine; they include often tweaked kern pairs.

### Export settings

Make sure to check the following items when exporting as TTF:

In particular, **old style 'kern'** is important for compatibility with older devices, like the Kobo devices that I am targeting specifically.

### Source files

I've included the original XCharter files in this repository, you can find them in the `/src` folder. 

You can download the TrueType version of these fonts via [Releases](https://github.com/nicoverbruggen/cartisse/releases), which are ready to be copied to your favorite e-reader. Alternatively, you can export the source files yourself.

## License

In 1992 Bitstream donated a version of Charter, along with its version of Courier, to the X Consortium under terms that allowed the font to be modified and redistributed.

This font is _not_ related to the proprietary version, Charter BT.

Cartisse is based on XCharter, but contains some metrics modifications and removes certain ligatures.
