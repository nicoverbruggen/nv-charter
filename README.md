## What is this?

This repository contains **NV Charter**, a renamed version of [XCharter](https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/xcharter/), which is an extended version of [Bitstream Charter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitstream_Charter).

This version omits a few ligatures that consistently looked bad on e-ink displays and has adjusted metrics for improved line height. A more clarified [license](./LICENSE) which is also included as part of the distributed font files.

## How was this made?

- A few ligatures were removed, namely: `ff`, `ffi`, `ffl`, `fl`, `fi`.
- A tweak was made to ensure the `fi` kern pair looks good now that the ligature is gone.
- Improved line height metrics were set (updated ascent/descent metrics).
- The font was renamed and re-exported with [FontForge](https://fontforge.org).
- The copyright notice has been updated to reflect the new name.

I've included the FontForge files in this repository.

## License

In 1992 Bitstream donated a version of Charter, along with its version of Courier, to the X Consortium under terms that allowed the font to be modified and redistributed.

This font is _not_ related to the proprietary version, Charter BT.

XCharter is an extension of Bitstream Charter, whose original license is reproduced below, as required under the terms of that license. The extension provides small caps, oldstyle figures and superior figures in all four styles, accompanied by LaTeX font support files.

NV Charter is based on XCharter, but contains some manual tweaks and adjustments to metrics for an improved digital reading experience.
